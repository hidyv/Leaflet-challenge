# Leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey provides real time data and information on earthquake observations around the world. This challenge provides a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

 Create earthquake visualization.

 
•	Plot the earthquakes around the world using the JSON data provided on the USGS website.
•	The circular markers indicate the sites of earthquake occurrences in the past seven days.
•	The size of the markers indicates the magnitude of the earthquake. The bigger the marker, the higher the magnitude.
•	The color of the markers indicates the depth of the earthquakes. The legend for the colors is available in the right-hand bottom corner of the visual.
•	Clicking on a marker displays the details of the earthquake which includes the location, magnitude the depth, the date and time of the earthquake in a pop-up.
